            <p>I worked as a C++ Programmer Intern at Studio397. My contributions were mostly related to the development of rFactor2. 
The following are some descriptions of my contributions:</p>
            
            <h3 class = "Subtitle"> Vehicle System Behaviors</h3>
            
            <p>For the first Part of my internship (lasting 3.5 months) involves working on quality of life improvements to the vehicle systems behavior in rFactor2. In order to do this, I had to work with an existing legacy codebase, and learn how to properly contribute to an on-going team project. In the end, I was able to get my changes approved by the code and QA team.</p>
            
            <h3 class = "Subtitle"> Particle System Research</h3>
            
            <p>	The second part of my internship (lasting 1.5 months) involves looking into the particle system of the game. I was tasked to create a summary of how the particle system currently works and suggest potential improvements. I also researched other third party particle system libraries and created a prototype integration of the NVIDIA Flow particle system into the game engine.</p>
