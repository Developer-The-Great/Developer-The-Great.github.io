         <p>I am currently working with 7 other developers in order to make a 3D game engine. My contribution to this project is mostly through 
         the Physics sides of things. I talk about this further <a href="CollisionDetection.html"> here.</a>. This project was definitely an interesting experience for me due to the fact that
         this is the first time where I could work with this many programmers. By having other programmers review the code I write, it helped me write cleaner, more  
         organized code (also learned a few neat tricks along the way!).
