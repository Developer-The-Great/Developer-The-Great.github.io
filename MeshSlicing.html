            <p>Mesh splitting is an important feature in voronoi based destruction systems.In these types of systems, due to the amount of slicing that is done, triangle based mesh slicing is not optimal anymore because it will create many thin and degenerate triangles even after a few slices. This was mentioned in "Real Time Dynamic Fracture with Volumetric Approximate Convex Decompositions" by Mathhias Muller.</p>
            
            <h3 class = "Subtitle"> Mesh Splitting</h3>
            
            <p>Due to the lack of sources on this subject, the mesh slicing algorithm is completely created from scratch. The idea behind this algorithm is that when we split a polygon, we only split 
            the edges that are effected by the split. We also reuse the boundary edges of the polygon so that adjacency information does not get deleted. This means that the polygons do not have to be regenerated/reconnected with each other after splitting. </p>
            
            <h3 class = "Subtitle"> Island Detection</h3>
            <p>One important benefit of polygon based mesh splitting is island detection. This means that parts of the mesh that were disjoint due to mesh slicing can be separated into different game
            objects. This process was shown when the hammer is split. This is possible due to the fact that a Half Edge Data Structure was created around the mesh</p>
