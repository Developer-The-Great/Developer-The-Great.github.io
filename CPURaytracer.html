         <p>This is a small application I made that, when given a text file containing a scene with a certain number of objects, can output an image of it using raytracing. This personal project was developed in 3 weeks. As seen in the image above, the application does support both ray triangle intersection checks and ray sphere intersection checks. Shading is done with Lambertian shading.</p>
