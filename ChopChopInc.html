            <p>Chop Chop Inc. is a first-person game about deforestation. The goal of the game is to teach people how excessive logging is unacceptable. I developed this project with 8 other people, the programming was done by me and another developer. The project took 2 months to develop. Here are some notable features I implemented:</p>
            
            <h3 class = "Subtitle"> Dynamic Tree Cutting</h3>
            
            <p>In order to make this game fun, the player should be able to have more freedom in the way that trees are cut. I was tasked to develop an algorithm that is able to dynamically split the trees. I talk more about this algorithm here.</p>
            
            <h3 class = "Subtitle"> Multithreading the cutting algorithm with the Unity Job System</h3>
            
            <p>	Some tree meshes have well over a few hundred vertices. Because of this, every time you cut a tree mesh, the player would experience a noticeable lag spike. In order to combat this, I was tasked with multithreading the cutting algorithm with the help of the Unity Job System.</p>
            
            <h3 class = "Subtitle"> Game Object Brush </h3>
            
            <p>	When one of the artists was decorating the scene, they had to sometimes manually place small details like rocks or bushes. Manually doing this was quite tedious for them. I was then tasked to create a ‘Game Object brush’ brush to help them do this.</p>
