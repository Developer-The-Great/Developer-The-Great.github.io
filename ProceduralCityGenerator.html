            <p>I was given the task to create an offline tool that, when given a set of parameters, can procedurally generate Cyberpunk’s “Night City”. Although the resulting algorithm is missing a lot of features that make it look like Night City, I did learn quite a lot from this project. </p>

            <p>Each of the buildings in night city were part of the one of the four architectural styles. Because each style was very different from each other, 4 separate algorithms were created in order to create each style. The images above are the buildings generated by my algorithm for each style.</p>
            <br>
            <p>One notable algorithm is the one used to create the “entropism” style. As shown in the video below, the algorithm is able to generate relatively unique and interesting buildings.</p>

            <p>The buildings that were created also needed to be procedurally placed. In order to do this, I created an algorithm that when given a set of points that show where a certain district lies, the algorithm will decide what type of building will be generated and how many of it can it generate given the space available.</p>
