            <p>I was given the task to create an offline tool that, when given a set of parameters, can procedurally generate Cyberpunk’s “Night City”. Although the resulting algorithm is missing a lot of features that make it look like Night City, I did learn quite a lot from this project. </p>

            <p>Each of the buildings in night city were part of the one of the four architectural styles. Because each style was very different from each other, 4 separate algorithms were created in order to create each style. The images above are the buildings generated by my algorithm for each style.</p>

            <h3 class = "Subtitle"> Entropism Buildings </h3>
            
            <p>One notable algorithm is the one used to create the “entropism” style, which consist of sprawling favela-like structures. In order to do this, I created a custom algorithm based on shape grammars and binary space partioning. As shown in the video below, the algorithm is able to create relatively unique buildings. </p>

            <h3 class = "Subtitle"> Procedural Mesh Generation </h3>
            
            <p>I was also requested to create some of the buildings found in the westbrook district of Night City. These consisted of n-gon prism like buildings. In order to do this, procedural object placement 
            was not optimal because variations in the shape and number of sides of the n-gon was requested. So, in order to generate this type of building, procedural mesh generation was used. These buildings are displayed above (Pic no. 3 from the left).</p>

            <img id="frameImage" src="../Developer-The-Great.github.io/img/layout.png" alt="Test Image " style="width:380px;height:350px;">
            
            <p>The buildings that were created also needed to be procedurally placed. In order to do this, I created an algorithm that when given a set of points that show where a certain district lies, the algorithm will decide what type of building will be generated and how many of it can it generate given the space available.</p>
