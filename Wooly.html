            <p>Wooly is an isometric puzzle game developed with a custom 3D engine called the PXG3D. The idea of the game is that you are given a number of sheep and your goal is to get them to the finish line. This project was developed with 5 other people with a duration of 3 weeks. The programming was done by me and 2 other programmers. Here are some notable features I implemented: </p>
            
            <h3 class = "Subtitle"> The game engine</h3>
            
            <p>As mentioned above, I developed the game engine to create this game. I discuss more about this engine here.</p>
            
            <h3 class = "Subtitle"> Raycasting</h3>
            
            <p>In this game, we wanted the player to be able click to use their mouse to click on a tile and move their. This would require some sort of raycaster to detect which tile was clicked. </p>
            
            <h3 class = "Subtitle"> Automatic node generation for pathfinding</h3>
            
            <p>As seen in the video above, this game also requires some sort of pathfinding. I got the task of finding a way of automatically generating the nodes for pathfinding.</p>
