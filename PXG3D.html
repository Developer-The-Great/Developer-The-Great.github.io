            <p>In order to learn more about how game engines work under the hood, and increase my proficiency in C++, I decided to develop a 3D Game Engine with C++ and OpenGL. This project took 1.5 months to develop and has the following features, mentioned below: </p>
            
            <h3 class = "Subtitle"> 1. Custom collision detection between any convex polyhedra</h3>
         
            <p>Using the seperating axis test,  PXG3D is able to detect if 2 objects with a convex collider are overlapping each other. I talk about this feature in detail here. </p>
            
            <h3 class = "Subtitle"> 2. Lighting with the Phong Reflection Model</h3>
            
            <p>PXG3D uses the phong reflection model to light a scene. It supports all three types of lights (point,directional, and spotlight) and supports multiple lights in one scene. </p>
            
            <h3 class = "Subtitle"> 3. GameObject-Component system for its runtime Game Object model.</h3>
            
            <p>A GameObject in PXG3D has a list of components. These components would have access to the GameObject its owned by and can modify its properties. Components can be easily added to modify its behaviour. </p>
