            <p>Feed the kids is a first-person cooking game developed in the Unity Game Engine. The goal is to serve a number of customers as fast as possible. The project was developed in 3 weeks with 5 other people. Most of the programming was done by me with the help of another developer. Here are some notable features that were implemented:</p>
            
            <h3 class = "Subtitle"> Food Cutting Algorithm </h3>
            
            <p>In this game, we wanted the player to have fun when they are cooking. I was tasked to create some sort of food cutting algorithm to simulate cutting food with a knife. Due to the time limit for this project, I decided to implement a more ‘naïve’ cutting algorithm that would need precut meshes. It would then separate the precut meshes to create the illusion of slicing.</p>
            
            <h3 class = "Subtitle"> Boiling water Shader</h3>
            
            <p>
            I was also tasked to create a boiling water shader for this game. This allowed me to learn a bit more about Unity Shaders.
            </p>
            
            <h3 class = "Subtitle"> Gameplay interactions</h3>
            
            <p>
                Most of the gameplay interactions (smooth camera movements, placing objects, student AI) are also the things I implemented.
